        <h1>More about me</h1>
        <p>
            It's always a fun, though often fruitless task to try and pinpoint the origin of someone's story.
            It's usually some combination of situation and temperament, and I'm not sure which one
            holds more true for me.
        </p>
        <p>
            For me, my story technically starts in foster care in the state of Connecticut, but
            if I really had to pick a moment where things started to make some semblance of sense, it would be here.
        </p>
        <p>
            On a random backroad in central Florida, just far enough away from excessive light pollution and 
            most likely worrying the residents of the nearby home with my eery presence in the middle of the street, this was my first
            time ever seeing what I would come to understand as the core of the galaxy we inhabit.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the longest time, I just called this the Milky Way, and I had no clue how much this 
            scene would come to mean to me.

      <p>
        At the time, I had been working in a warehouse and dabbling in some product photography
        for the same company, though my experience with photography had actually began a year 
        earlier when I got my first DSLR.
      </p>
      <p>
        That first camera became mine for the sole reason of taking pictures of my first new car, my 
        beloved Mini that I eventually drove across country and that still gets me around today. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Gradually, my interests broadened from taking photos of my car at sunset into taking photos of the 
        sunsets themselves, which were an undeniably gorgeous feature of that sweaty corner of the state.  
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <p>
        My first photos were extremely hit or miss, and I have about 100 gigabytes of photos from that original
        DSLR to prove it. But, the dynamic sunsets and easy beach access made it quite easy to begin learning the basics
        on my own while avoiding total discouragement. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, I began using the camera enough that I was bumping up against its limits quite frequently.
        I saved up for a while, and made a modest upgrade to a more modern DSLR camera. (For those camera curious,
        it was from a Nikon D5200 to a D500)

        Trying to make sure that the small fortune I had saved for the new camera 
        didn't go to waste, 
        I embarked on a challenge I had just recently seen someone else do, 
        called "Project 365".
      </p>
      <p>
        It was obviously an optimistic goal, but I did see some rapid improvement 
        in my understanding of the basics, and it resulted in some of my favorite 
        images to this day.

            I really got some wind in my sails when I had a few images featured in a calendar
            put together by a local newspaper. From there, I began finding ways that I could 
            turn this interest into a career.

        It wasn't long until I upgraded my camera once more, and began pursuing real work. I began

        This was at the tail end of my "Project 365", and I really began to hit my stride.
