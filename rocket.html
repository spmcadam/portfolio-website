    <h2>Getting Starship to orbit</h2>
    <p>
      This page is from a project inspired by chapter 1 of "Computational Physics", a book 
      we'll be working out of for the class of the same name in my last year of the Physics
      BS program.
    </p>
    <p>
      The code began as a simple 1D example where a rocket takes off and flies purely upward. 
      It consisted of only "for" loops in Python and originally just used equations of motion 
      with known parameters for Starship.   
    </p>
    <p>
      I then increased the complexity of the simulation, adding in elements for aerodynamic drag 
      and moved to 2D. I also added in the stage separation event, and created separate events 
      for the stage 2 initial burn, coast phase, and insertion burn. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The last piece was moving to 3D, which for the sake of keeping the codebase slim, I've only 
      included that portion here. At this current stage, the parameters are currently limited to 
      what I've found to be the most sensitive to changes. 
    </p>
    <li>
      <strong>Vertical velocity before pitch change:</strong> how much the vertical velocity to gain from launch until
      the rocket begins pitching over. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Percentage of dV for stage 2:</strong> controls how much dV is spent for the initial 
      stage 2 burn. The remainder will be spent after the specified coast time.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Coast time:</strong> how long is spent between the two burns of the second stage.
    </li>
    <p>
      Below the simulation, I walk through the steps of putting this code together, and the 
      physical consequences of each input.
