      <h1>Hello, I'm Sean.</h1>
      <p>
        I’ll be graduating in June 2025 with a Physics BS and two years of experience in astrophysics research.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this site, aside from building experience with getting my Python programs to work within an HTML/CSS website,
        is to highlight some of the things I've accomplished.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll mainly find some coding projects and writing, but also photos from my time as a photographer. 
        All of the photos, video, and code 
        on this site are my own.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any questions about
        what you find, please reach out using any of the contact information listed.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm an undergaduate astrophysics researcher at Western Washington University, junior programmer, and former photographer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years of earning my Physics BS, I've had the fortune of filling a variety 
      of roles within the department.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've worked as a teaching assistant in a variety of
      introductory labs and required labs for STEM majors, as an assistant to the Lead Engineering Tech where
      I became familiar with a variety of equipment and software, in research where I developed
      what I get to ostentatiously call a method of "hyperdimensional analysis", and at the planetarium where 
      I'm currently learning the ropes of the proprietary software and developing a users guide for new students.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of this journey at Western, I'm proudly walking away with a solid foundation of understanding of
      the physics that govern our universe, a great deal of experience in communicating complex topics to a wide variety
      of people, and some deeply enriching experience through wearing as many hats as I could around the department.
    </p>
    <p>
