            <h1>Hello, I'm Sean.</h1>
            <p>
              I’ll be graduating in June 2025 with a Physics BS and two years of experience in astrophysics research.

              The purpose of all this is to highlight some of the things I've accomplished, or am actively working on.
              It's mainly some writing and coding projects, but also photos from my foray as a photographer and the site itself.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm an undergaduate astrophysics researcher, coder, and former photographer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years of earning my Physics BS, I've had the fortune of working just about every
      position that I could within the department.  
    </p>
    <p>
      I've worked as a teaching assistant in a variety of
      introductory labs and required labs for STEM majors, as an assistant to the Lead Engineering Tech where
      I became familiar with a variety of equipment and software, in research where I developed
      what I get to ostentatiously call a method of "hyperdimensional analysis", and at the planetarium where 
      I'm currently learning the ropes of the proprietary software and developing a users guide for new students.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of this journey at Western, I'm proudly walking away with a solid foundation of understanding of
      the physics that govern our universe, a knack for communicating complex topics to a wide variety
      of people, and some deeply enriching experience in filling the various 
      roles of the department.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're interested in reaching out to me for more information, please use any of the contact methods provided below.
      If you have some time and want to see some pretty pictures while learning more about how I made it from photography to
      physics, follow the link below.
